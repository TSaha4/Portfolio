# Hello 👋 #

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a Computer Science undergraduate with a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Having gained hands-on experience in Web Development, I am currently focused on expanding my skill set in Data Science with dedication and enthusiasm. This repository showcases some of my key projects.

### 🔹 Fashion Classification – Logistic Regression on Fashion MNIST  
A simple ML project to classify clothing items from the **Fashion MNIST** dataset using **Logistic Regression**.

- Preprocessed and visualized 60,000+ grayscale clothing images (28×28 pixels)  
- Applied normalization, missing value handling, and class-stratified train-test splitting  
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model with the **multinomial approach** (10 classes)  
- Achieved **85.26% accuracy** on the test dataset  
- Evaluated with classification reports and a visualized confusion matrix  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

A web-based plant assistant that lets users search for plants by name or image and get care tips.

- Integrated **Plant.id API** for image-based plant identification  
- Used a local **JSON database** of 50+ plants to simulate watering schedules and plant details  
- Displayed Amazon links for accessories and fertilizers  
- User-friendly interface with scrollable sections (About, Contact, Search)  
- Handles both **text and image search** with name matching and scientific name fallback  
- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla), Plant.id API, JSON
